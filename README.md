# Arabic-News-Detection

This project presents a complete system for detecting and classifying Arabic news articles using various machine learning and deep learning techniques, including transformer-based models.

## 📚 Abstract

We address the challenge of Arabic news classification due to language complexity, diverse dialects, and rich morphology. We built models using traditional and deep learning techniques (Naive Bayes, SVM, CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, BERT, AraBERT, AraELECTRA, etc.) on the SANAD dataset.

## 🚀 Features

- Arabic text preprocessing (normalization, diacritics removal, etc.)
- Word embedding: Word2Vec (Skip-gram & CBOW), FastText
- Classical ML models: Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest
- Deep learning models: CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, BiGRU
- Transformer models: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT AraBERT, AraELECTRA, Arabic DistilBERT , MARBERT
- Streamlit web application for real-time classification

## 📚 Dataset

**SANAD Dataset**  
Collected from:
- AlKhaleej
- AlArabiya
- Akhbarona

## 📈 Results
 -AraELECTRA and AraBERT achieved the best classification performance.

 -FastText embeddings significantly improved the performance of LSTM models.

## 🧠 Future Work

🌍 Multilingual support (e.g., French, English)

⚡ Real-time classification improvements using lightweight models

🤖 Fake news detection using GPT-based models

🧬 Hybrid architectures combining CNN/RNN with Transformers
